; EXPERIMENTAL. DO NOT USE.
;
; Putting this here for safe keeping as we'll need this later for
; building and assembling.
;
; Right now theres no need to actually use it.
;
; In the unlikely case, this requires racket-lang along with
; rash, charterm, and rackjure which all facilitate writing
; scheme-and-clojure'ish racket-lang shell code (which brings me joy).
;
; After you install racket do this:
;
; $ raco pkg install charterm
; $ raco pkg install rackjure
; $ raco pkg install rash
